//想要把聲音的最重要的頻率(Hz)找出來,使用PitchDetector物件
/**
 * This sketch shows how to use the PitchDetector class to detect the pitch 
 * (also known as the 'fundamental frequency') of a sound signal. For complex 
 * signals this is not a trivial task, so the analyzer not only returns the pitch 
 * (measured in Hertz, or 'Hz') but also a 'confidence level' in that measurement.
